# USDA 2020 State-Level Grain Production Data

This directory contains Excel workbooks with data downloaded from https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/ that reports the total bushels of some specified grain commodity produced at a state level in 2020. We will use this data to help us narrow our analysis down to the states that are leaders in producing a specified grain. We do this to avoid putting unneeded bias into our data. For example, Arizona does not contribute much to total American corn production, so we should not let their climate skew our data.
